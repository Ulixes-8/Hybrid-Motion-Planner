# Chimera Planner

A hybrid autonomous vehicle motion planner that intelligently combines rule-based (PDM-Closed) and learning-based (Diffusion Planner) approaches.

## Overview

Chimera leverages the strengths of both planning paradigms:
- **PDM-Closed**: Fast, reliable rule-based planner for normal driving scenarios
- **Diffusion Planner**: Sophisticated learning-based planner for complex scenarios

## Architecture

The hybrid planner implements:
- Dual-frequency execution (PDM @ 10Hz, Diffusion @ 2Hz)
- Intelligent switching based on scenario detection and performance scores
- Unified trajectory scoring using PDM's evaluation metrics
